  <div class="content p-5" id="html">
    <span id="cross" onclick="undo('html')">╳</span>
    <h4 class="p-3 text-center">HTML</h4>
    <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web
      applications. It provides a structure for the content on a webpage by using a series of elements, which are
      represented by tags enclosed in angle brackets <>. HTML tags tell the browser how to display the content,
        whether it's text, images, links, or other media.</p>
    <p><b>1. Elements:</b> HTML documents are made up of elements, which are the building blocks of the webpage. Each
      element
      consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. For example:
    <p class="text-center bg-secondary text-white p-2">&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph in HTML.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
    </p>
    <p><b>2. Attributes:</b> HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information about the element.
      Attributes are specified within the opening tag and usually come in name-value pairs. For example:
    <p class="text-center bg-secondary text-white p-2">&lt;a href=""&gt;Attributes in HTML&lt;/a&gt;</p>
    </p>
    <p><b>3. Tags:</b> HTML tags define the structure and content of the webpage. Some common tags include:
    <ul>
      <li>&lt;html&gt;: Defines the root of an HTML document.</li>
      <li>&lt;head&gt;: Contains metadata about the document, such as the title and links to stylesheets.</li>
      <li>&lt;title&gt;: Sets the title of the document, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.</li>
      <li>&lt;body&gt;: Contains the content of the document, such as text, images, links, and other elements.</li>
      <li>&lt;p&gt;: Defines a paragraph.</li>
      <li>&lt;a&gt;: Defines a hyperlink.</li>
      <li>&lt;img&gt;: Inserts an image.</li>
      <li>&lt;div&gt;: Defines a division or section in a document.</li>
      <li>&lt;span&gt;: Defines a section of text within another element.</li>
      <li>&lt;ul&gt;, &lt;ol&gt;, &lt;li&gt;: Used to create unordered and ordered lists.</li>

  <div class="content p-5" id="css">
    <span id="cross" onclick="undo('css')">╳</span>
    <h4 class="p-3 text-center">CSS</h4>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a
      document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS defines how HTML elements should be displayed on screen, in
      print, or in other media types. It enables web developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and
      other visual aspects of a web page or application.</p>
    <b>Presentation : </b>
    <p> CSS is used to control the visual presentation of web pages. It allows developers to define styles for
      elements such as fonts, colors, spacing, layout, and more. By separating the structure (HTML) from the
      presentation (CSS), developers can create visually appealing and consistent designs across multiple pages.</p>
    <b>Responsive Design : </b>
    <p> CSS enables the creation of responsive web designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Media
      queries in CSS allow developers to apply different styles based on factors like screen width, enabling websites
      to be optimized for desktops, tablets, and smartphones.</p>
    <b>Layout Control : </b>
    <p>CSS provides powerful layout capabilities, allowing developers to control the positioning and arrangement of
      elements on a web page. This includes techniques such as flexbox and grid layout, which offer more advanced and
      flexible options for creating complex layouts compared to traditional methods.</p>
    <b>Accessibility : </b>
    <p> CSS can be used to improve the accessibility of web content by providing styles that enhance readability,
      navigation, and usability for users with disabilities. For example, CSS can be used to define high-contrast
      color schemes, provide alternative text for images, and ensure proper focus management for keyboard navigation.
    </p>
    <b>Performance Optimization :</b>
    <p>CSS can help improve the performance of web pages by reducing the size of the files that need to be downloaded
      by the browser. By externalizing styles into separate CSS files and minimizing redundancy, developers can ensure
      faster loading times and improved user experience.</p>
    <b>Browser Compatibility :</b>
    <p>CSS helps ensure consistency in how web pages are displayed across different web browsers. While browsers may
      have their own default styles, CSS allows developers to override these styles and apply consistent styling
      across all browsers, ensuring a uniform experience for users.</p>

  <div class="content p-5" id="js">
    <span id="cross" onclick="undo('js')">╳</span>
    <h4 class="p-3 text-center">JavaScript</h4>
    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for building dynamic and
      interactive websites. It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML (Hypertext Markup
      Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). JavaScript allows developers to add functionality to web pages,
      enabling features such as dynamic content updates, interactive forms, multimedia playback, and more.</p>
    <b>Client-Side Interactivity : </b>
    <p>JavaScript allows for dynamic and interactive web pages. It enables you to create
      features such as form validation, interactive maps, sliders, dropdown menus, and much more, enhancing user
      experience.</p>
    <b>Asynchronous Communication :</b>
    <p> JavaScript facilitates asynchronous communication with servers using AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML).
      This enables web pages to make requests to the server without reloading the entire page, resulting in faster and
      smoother user experiences.</p>
    <b>Cross-Browser Compatibility : </b>
    <p> JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, making it a reliable choice for developing web applications
      that work consistently across different browsers and platforms.</p>
    <b>Rich User Interfaces : </b>
    <p> With JavaScript frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js, developers can build rich and
      responsive user interfaces, allowing for complex single-page applications (SPAs) that rival traditional desktop
      applications in terms of functionality and performance.</p>
    <b>Server-Side Development : </b>
    <p> With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript can now be used for server-side development as well. This enables
      developers to use a single language (JavaScript) for both client-side and server-side programming, streamlining
      the development process and reducing </p>

    <h4 class=" p-3 text-center">GIT</h4>
    <p> Git is a distributed version control system that enables developers to track changes, collaborate effectively,
      manage branches, and maintain the integrity of their codebase throughout the software development lifecycle.
    </p>
    <b>Version Control System (VCS) : </b>
    <p>Git allows developers to manage and track changes to their codebase over time. It records each modification
      made to files, including who made the changes and when they were made. This history enables developers to revert
      to previous versions, compare changes, and collaborate effectively.</p>
    <b>Distributed System :</b>
    <p> Git is a distributed version control system, meaning that each developer has a complete copy of the entire
      repository, including its history. This decentralization allows developers to work offline, commit changes
      locally, and synchronize with remote repositories when an internet connection is available.</p>
    <b>Branching and Merging :</b>
    <p>Git provides powerful branching and merging capabilities, allowing developers to create separate lines of
      development (branches) for new features, bug fixes, or experiments. Developers can work on different branches
      simultaneously and merge their changes back into the main codebase when ready.</p>
    <b>Collaboration :</b>
    <p> Git facilitates collaboration among developers working on the same project. Multiple developers can work on
      different branches independently, and Git helps reconcile their changes when merging branches together. Git also
      supports code reviews, enabling team members to review and comment on each other's code before merging it into
      the main branch.</p>
    <b>Remote Repositories: </b>
    <p>Git allows developers to host their code on remote repositories, such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. These
      remote repositories serve as centralized hubs for sharing and collaborating on code. Developers can push their
      changes to remote repositories and pull changes made by others, enabling seamless collaboration across
      distributed teams.</p>
    <b>Speed and Efficiency : </b>
    <p> Git is designed to be fast and efficient, even when working with large codebases and repositories. It uses
      advanced algorithms for storing and compressing data, enabling quick operations such as committing changes,
      branching, merging, and retrieving commit history.</p>
    <b>Open Source and Community :</b>
    <p>Git is open-source software, meaning that its source code is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and
      distribute. It has a vibrant community of users and contributors who actively contribute to its development,
      provide support, and share best practices.</p>

    <h4 class=" p-3 text-center">PNPM</h4>
    <p>PNPM is a package manager for JavaScript projects. It stands for "Plug'n'Play Node Package Manager". PNPM
      provides an alternative approach to package management compared to traditional package managers like npm or Yarn.
      Here's a brief overview of PNPM</p>
    <b>Plug'n'Play:</b>
    <p>PNPM introduces the concept of "Plug'n'Play", which allows packages to be installed in a global store rather than
      being duplicated in each project's <code>node_modules</code> directory. This reduces disk space usage and speeds
      up installation and dependency resolution.</p>

    <b>Efficient Disk Usage:</b>
    <p>By using a global store for packages, PNPM eliminates duplicate packages across multiple projects. This results
      in significant savings in disk space, especially when working on multiple projects with overlapping dependencies.
    </p>

    <b>Faster Installations:</b>
    <p>PNPM's approach to package management typically leads to faster installation times compared to traditional
      package managers. Since packages are shared across projects, there's no need to download and install duplicate
      copies of the same package for each project.</p>

    <b>Workspace Support:</b>
    <p>PNPM provides support for managing monorepos or workspaces, where multiple related projects are stored in a
      single repository. It allows you to install dependencies for all projects within the workspace efficiently.</p>

    <b>Compatibility:</b>
    <p>PNPM is fully compatible with existing npm and Yarn workflows. It supports common package management commands
      such as <code>install</code>, <code>update</code>, <code>remove</code>, and <code>list</code>, making it easy to
      switch to PNPM without significant changes to your development workflow.</p>

    <b>Integrity Checks:</b>
    <p>PNPM performs integrity checks to ensure that dependencies are installed correctly and securely. It verifies the
      integrity of packages in the global store to prevent tampering or corruption.</p>

    <b>Community Support:</b>
    <p>PNPM is an open-source project with an active community of contributors and users. It receives regular updates
      and improvements, ensuring compatibility with the latest JavaScript ecosystem trends and best practices.</p>

  <!-- YARN CONTENT START -->
  <div class="content p-5" id="yarn">
    <span id="cross" onclick="undo('yarn')">╳</span>
    <h4 class=" p-3 text-center">YARN</h4>
    <p>
      Yarn is a package manager for JavaScript projects. It was developed by Facebook and is widely used in the
      JavaScript ecosystem for managing dependencies efficiently. Yarn provides several features that streamline the
      process of package management and improve the performance of dependency resolution. Here's an overview of Yarn's
      key features</p>
    <b>Fast and Reliable:</b>
    <p>Yarn is known for its speed and reliability. It uses a global cache to store downloaded packages, reducing the
      need to download dependencies repeatedly. Yarn also parallelizes package installations, resulting in faster
      dependency resolution and installation times.</p>

    <b>Deterministic Dependency Resolution:</b>
    <p>Yarn ensures deterministic dependency resolution by using a lock file (<code>yarn.lock</code>). This file
      specifies the exact versions of all dependencies and ensures that the same dependencies are installed across
      different environments or machines, preventing unexpected behavior due to version mismatches.</p>

    <b>Offline Mode:</b>
    <p>Yarn provides an offline mode that allows developers to install dependencies without an internet connection. By
      caching packages locally, Yarn enables developers to work on projects offline or in environments with limited
      internet access.</p>

    <b>Workspaces:</b>
    <p>Yarn supports workspaces, which are useful for managing monorepos or multi-package repositories. Workspaces allow
      developers to link multiple packages within a single repository and manage their dependencies collectively. This
      simplifies development workflows and improves code organization.</p>

    <b>Plug'n'Play (PnP):</b>
    <p>Yarn introduced Plug'n'Play (PnP) as an experimental feature to improve package resolution and reduce disk space
      usage. PnP eliminates the need for a <code>node_modules</code> directory by resolving packages at runtime. This
      results in faster startup times and reduced disk space usage.</p>

    <b>Interactive CLI:</b>
    <p>Yarn provides an interactive command-line interface (CLI) with helpful prompts and suggestions. The interactive
      CLI makes it easier for developers to navigate through commands, manage dependencies, and troubleshoot issues
      effectively.</p>

    <b>Extensibility:</b>
    <p>Yarn is highly extensible and supports plugins that enhance its functionality. Developers can create custom
      plugins to integrate Yarn with other tools or add new features to suit their specific requirements.</p>

    <b>Community Support:</b>
    <p>Yarn has a vibrant community of developers and contributors who actively maintain and improve the project. The
      community provides support, documentation, and resources to help users get the most out of Yarn and address any
      issues they encounter.</p>

    <h4 class=" p-3 text-center">NPM</h4>
    <p>NPM (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for Node.js, a runtime environment for executing JavaScript
      code outside a web browser. While Git is a version control system that helps developers manage changes to their
      codebase, NPM complements Git by providing a way to manage project dependencies, scripts, and configurations.
      Here's why NPM is commonly used alongside Git:</p>
    <b>Dependency Management :</b>
    <p>NPM simplifies the process of managing project dependencies, such as libraries, frameworks, and tools.
      Developers can define dependencies in a package.json file, specifying the required packages and their versions.
      NPM can then automatically download and install these dependencies from the NPM registry, ensuring that all team
      members have access to the same set of dependencies.</p>
    <b>Script Execution :</b>
    <p>: NPM allows developers to define custom scripts in the package.json file, which can be executed using the npm
      run command. These scripts can automate common tasks such as building, testing, linting, and deploying the
      project. By centralizing scripts in the package.json file, developers can easily share and execute them across
      different environments.</p>
    <b>Version Management :</b>
    <p>NPM helps manage package versions by allowing developers to specify version ranges or use semantic versioning
      (SemVer) for dependencies. This ensures that projects remain compatible with specific versions of packages and
      can easily upgrade to newer versions without breaking existing functionality. Git, on the other hand, manages
      versions at the repository level, tracking changes to files and directories over time.</p>
    <b>Registry Integration : </b>
    <p> NPM provides access to a vast ecosystem of open-source packages available on the NPM registry. Developers can
      publish their own packages to the registry and consume packages published by others. Git repositories often
      contain configuration files, source code, and documentation, whereas NPM packages contain reusable libraries and
      modules that can be easily shared and reused across projects.</p>
    <b>Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) :</b>
    <p>NPM integrates with CI/CD pipelines, enabling automated testing, building, and deployment of projects. CI/CD
      tools such as Jenkins, Travis CI, and GitHub Actions can use NPM to install dependencies and execute scripts as
      part of the build process. This helps streamline development workflows and ensures consistent build environments
      across different stages of the development lifecycle.</p>

  <!-- SASS CONTENT START ------------------------------------->
  <div class="content p-5" id="sass">
    <span id="cross" onclick="undo('sass')">╳</span>
    <h4 class="p-3 text-center">SASS</h4>
    <p>Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a preprocessor scripting language that extends CSS with additional
      features like variables, nesting, mixins, functions, and more. While CSS is powerful on its own, Sass enhances
      the capabilities of CSS and offers several benefits for web developers</p>
    <b>Variables :</b>
    <p>Sass allows developers to define variables to store values that are reused throughout the stylesheet. This
      makes it easier to maintain consistency and make global style changes. For example, instead of hardcoding colors
      or font sizes multiple times, developers can define variables such as $primary-color or $font-size.</p>
    <b>Nesting :</b>
    <p>Sass supports nesting of CSS selectors, allowing developers to write more concise and readable stylesheets.
      Instead of repeating parent selectors for nested elements, developers can nest child selectors inside their
      parent selectors, making the stylesheet structure more intuitive and easier to understand.</p>
    <b>Mixins :</b>
    <p>Mixins in Sass enable developers to define reusable blocks of CSS styles that can be included in multiple
      selectors. Mixins can accept parameters, making them versatile for generating different styles based on input
      values. This reduces code duplication and makes it easier to maintain consistent styles across the project.</p>
    <b>Functions :</b>
    <p> Sass provides built-in functions and allows developers to define custom functions for manipulating values,
      performing calculations, and generating dynamic styles. Functions add flexibility to stylesheet development and
      enable more advanced styling techniques.</p>
    <b>Partials and Imports :</b>
    <p>Sass supports splitting stylesheets into smaller, modular files called partials. Each partial can contain a
      subset of styles related to a specific component or feature. Sass also allows developers to import partials into
      a main stylesheet, making it easier to organize and manage large codebases.</p>
    <b>Extend/Inheritance :</b>
    <p> Sass supports the @extend directive, which allows selectors to inherit styles from other selectors. This
      promotes code reuse and helps keep styles DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself). However, it's important to use @extend
      judiciously to avoid generating inefficient or bloated CSS output.</p>
    <b>Compatibility :</b>
    <p>Sass is compatible with all versions of CSS, meaning that developers can gradually introduce Sass features into
      existing CSS codebases without requiring a complete rewrite. Sass files can be compiled into standard CSS using
      a compiler or preprocessor, ensuring compatibility with all web browsers.</p>

    <h4 class="p-3 text-center">REACT JS</h4>
    <p>React.js is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly for
      single-page applications and complex user interfaces. It has gained widespread adoption in the web development
      community due to several key features and benefits</p>
    <b>Component-Based Architecture :</b>
    <p>React.js uses a component-based architecture, allowing developers to break down the user interface into
      reusable and encapsulated components. This modular approach makes it easier to build and maintain large-scale
      applications, as each component can be developed, tested, and debugged independently.</p>
    <b>Virtual DOM :</b>
    <p>React.js uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model), a lightweight representation of the actual DOM tree. When
      changes are made to the UI, React updates the virtual DOM first, compares it with the previous version, and then
      efficiently updates only the necessary parts of the actual DOM. This approach minimizes browser reflows and
      improves performance, especially in applications with dynamic data and frequent UI updates.</p>
    <b>Declarative Syntax :</b>
    <p>React.js uses a declarative syntax, allowing developers to describe how the UI should look based on the
      application's current state. Instead of imperatively manipulating the DOM to update UI elements, developers
      define the desired UI state using JSX (JavaScript XML) syntax, which is more intuitive and easier to understand.
      This leads to more predictable code and reduces the risk of bugs caused by manual DOM manipulation.</p>
    <b>JSX :</b>
    <p> JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript
      files. It seamlessly integrates HTML markup with JavaScript logic, making it easier to create and maintain UI
      components. JSX is transpiled into regular JavaScript code by tools like Babel, enabling developers to leverage
      the full power of JavaScript while building UIs.</p>
    <b>Reusable Components : </b>
    <p> React.js promotes the reuse of components, allowing developers to create modular and composable UIs.
      Components can be composed together to build complex user interfaces, and they can be reused across different
      parts of the application or even in multiple applications. This improves code maintainability, reduces
      duplication, and speeds up development.</p>
    <b>Unidirectional Data Flow : </b>
    <p>React.js follows a unidirectional data flow model, where data flows down from parent components to child
      components via props (properties). This makes it easier to reason about data flow and maintain consistency
      within the application. Additionally, React provides mechanisms like state management and context API to manage
      application state and share data between components.</p>
    <b>Large Ecosystem and Community :</b>
    <p>React.js has a large and active community of developers, who contribute to its ecosystem by creating libraries,
      tools, and resources to enhance productivity and solve common challenges. There are numerous third-party
      libraries, frameworks, and UI component libraries available for React, providing developers with a wide range of
      options for building modern web applications.</p>

    <h4 class="p-3 text-center">Angular JS</h4>
    <p>AngularJS is an open-source JavaScript framework developed by Google for building dynamic web applications. It
      extends HTML with additional attributes and directives to create rich and interactive user interfaces. AngularJS
      follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and promotes modular and reusable code.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Data Binding:</b> AngularJS provides two-way data binding, which synchronizes the data between the model
        and the view automatically. Any changes to the model are reflected in the view, and vice versa, without the need
        for manual DOM manipulation.</li>
      <li><b>Directives:</b> AngularJS introduces directives, which are HTML attributes or elements that extend the
        functionality of HTML. Directives allow developers to create custom behaviors, such as looping through arrays,
        conditionally rendering elements, and manipulating the DOM.</li>
      <li><b>Dependency Injection:</b> AngularJS uses dependency injection to manage dependencies between different
        components of an application. This promotes loose coupling and makes components more reusable and testable.</li>
      <li><b>Modular Design:</b> AngularJS encourages a modular design approach, where applications are divided into
        small, reusable components called modules. Modules encapsulate related functionality and can be easily combined
        to build complex applications.</li>
      <li><b>Routing:</b> AngularJS includes a built-in routing module that allows developers to define navigation paths
        and load different views based on the URL. This enables the creation of single-page applications (SPAs) with
        multiple views and a fluid user experience.</li>
      <li><b>Services:</b> AngularJS provides services, which are singleton objects that perform specific tasks, such as
        making HTTP requests, managing authentication, or caching data. Services promote code reuse and encapsulate
        common functionality.</li>
      <li><b>Testing Support:</b> AngularJS is designed with testability in mind and provides support for unit testing
        and end-to-end testing. The framework includes tools like Jasmine and Protractor for writing and running tests,
        ensuring the reliability and quality of applications.</li>
      <li><b>Community and Ecosystem:</b> AngularJS has a large and active community of developers who contribute
        plugins, extensions, and resources to the ecosystem. The community provides support, tutorials, and best
        practices to help developers learn and adopt AngularJS in their projects.</li>

    <h4 class="p-3 text-center">VUE JS</h4>
    <p>Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. It is designed from the ground up
      to be incrementally adoptable, allowing developers to add Vue.js to existing projects or use it to build new
      applications entirely. Vue.js is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and reactivity.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Declarative Rendering:</b> Vue.js uses a template-based syntax that allows developers to declaratively
        define the UI components and their behavior. This makes it easy to understand and write HTML-based views without
        the need for complex JavaScript logic.</li>
      <li><b>Component-Based Architecture:</b> Vue.js promotes a component-based architecture, where applications are
        divided into reusable and composable components. Components encapsulate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript logic, making
        them self-contained and easier to manage.</li>
      <li><b>Reactivity:</b> Vue.js implements a reactive data-binding system, which automatically updates the DOM when
        the underlying data changes. This allows developers to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces without
        manually manipulating the DOM.</li>
      <li><b>Virtual DOM:</b> Vue.js uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the real DOM. The virtual DOM is a
        lightweight representation of the actual DOM, which Vue.js uses to compute the minimal number of changes needed
        to update the UI, resulting in improved performance.</li>
      <li><b>Vue CLI:</b> Vue.js provides a command-line interface (CLI) tool called Vue CLI for scaffolding and
        managing Vue.js projects. Vue CLI offers features like project generation, development server, build
        optimization, and plugin support, streamlining the development process.</li>
      <li><b>Vue Router:</b> Vue.js comes with Vue Router, a routing library for building single-page applications
        (SPAs). Vue Router allows developers to define navigation routes, load different views based on the URL, and
        manage application state seamlessly.</li>
      <li><b>Vuex:</b> Vue.js integrates with Vuex, a state management pattern and library, for managing application
        state in large-scale Vue.js applications. Vuex provides a centralized store for storing and managing shared data
        across components, enabling predictable state management.</li>
      <li><b>Server-Side Rendering (SSR):</b> Vue.js supports server-side rendering (SSR), allowing developers to render
        Vue.js applications on the server and send pre-rendered HTML to the client. SSR improves performance, search
        engine optimization (SEO), and initial load times for Vue.js applications.</li>
      <li><b>Community and Ecosystem:</b> Vue.js has a vibrant community of developers who contribute plugins,
        components, and resources to the ecosystem. The community provides extensive documentation, tutorials, and
        support to help developers learn and adopt Vue.js in their projects.</li>

    <h4 class="p-3 text-center">INTERNET</h4>
    <b>What is domain name ?</b>
    <p>A domain name is a human-readable label that serves as an easy-to-remember address for locating resources on
      the internet. It is used to identify and locate specific websites, web pages, email servers, and other internet
      resources. Domain names are part of the Domain Name System (DNS), which acts as a decentralized directory system
      for mapping domain names to their corresponding IP addresses.</p>
    <b>Web Server</b>
    <p>A web server is a software application or hardware device that serves web content to clients over the internet
      or an intranet. It responds to requests from web browsers or other clients, delivering web pages, files, or
      other resources in response to those requests. Web servers play a crucial role in the functioning of the World
      Wide Web by hosting and delivering websites and web applications to users worldwide.</p>
    <b>Client Server Architecture</b>
    <p>Client-server architecture is a computing model that divides tasks or processes between clients and servers in
      a networked environment. In this architecture, clients and servers communicate with each other to accomplish
      various tasks, such as accessing resources, sharing data, or processing requests. </p>
    <b>URI/URL</b>
    <ul class="mt-2"><b>URI (Uniform Resource Identifier):</b>
      <li>A URI is a string of characters used to identify a resource on the internet.</li>
      <li> It can identify various types of resources, including web pages, files, images, services, and more.</li>
      <li> URIs can be further classified into two subtypes: URLs and URNs (Uniform Resource Names).</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="mt-2"><b>URL (Uniform Resource Locator) :</b>
      <li>A URL is a specific type of URI that provides the means to locate and access a resource on the internet.
      </li>
      <li>It typically consists of several components, including the protocol (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS), domain name or IP
        address, path, query parameters, and fragment identifier.</li>
      <li>URLs are commonly used to specify the address of web pages, files, and other resources on the World Wide
        Web.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>What is DNS?</b>
    <p>DNS stands for Domain Name System. It is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or
      any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. DNS translates human-readable domain names (such as
      example.com) into the numerical IP addresses (such as 192.0.2.1) that computers use to identify each other on
      the network.</p>
    <b>HTTP</b>
    <P>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application-layer protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents,
      such as HTML files, over the World Wide Web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between web
      servers and web clients, enabling the exchange of data and communication between them.</P>
    <b>HTTP Cookies and Session</b>
    <ul class="mt-2"><b>HTTP Cookies :</b>
      <li>HTTP cookies are small pieces of data sent from a web server to a web client and stored locally on the
        client's device (usually in the browser).</li>
      <li>Cookies are typically used to store information such as user preferences, session identifiers,
        authentication tokens, and shopping cart contents.</li>
      <li>Cookies consist of key-value pairs and optional attributes such as expiration date, domain, and path.</li>
      <li>When a web client makes subsequent requests to the same server, it sends the stored cookies along with the
        request headers, allowing the server to retrieve and use the stored information.</li>
      <li>Cookies can be either session cookies (stored temporarily and deleted when the browser session ends) or
        persistent cookies (stored on the client's device for a specified duration).</li>
      <li>Cookies are commonly used for tracking user activity, implementing user authentication, and personalizing
        content for individual users.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="mt-2"><b>HTTP Sessions :</b>
      <li>Sessions are server-side data structures used to maintain stateful interactions between a web server and a
        specific client over a series of HTTP requests and responses.</li>
      <li>When a client establishes a session with a server (usually after successful authentication), the server
        generates a unique session identifier (session ID) and stores session-related data on the server.</li>
      <li>The session ID is typically stored as a cookie on the client's device, allowing the client to send the
        session ID along with subsequent requests to the server.</li>
      <li>On the server side, the session ID is used to retrieve session data associated with the client from the
        server's session storage.</li>
      <li>Session data can include user authentication status, user-specific settings, shopping cart contents, and
        other temporary information needed for the duration of the session.</li>
      <li>Sessions are typically used for managing user authentication and maintaining user-specific state across
        multiple requests within a single browsing session.</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Browsers and how it work’s</b>
    <p>Web browsers are software applications that allow users to access and interact with information on the World
      Wide Web. They interpret HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to render web pages, and they provide features such as
      navigation tools, bookmarking, and extensions.</p>
    <b>Web Hosting</b>
    <p>Web hosting is a service provided by companies known as web hosts or hosting providers, wherein they allocate
      server space and resources to store and serve website files and content to users over the internet. In simpler
      terms, web hosting enables individuals and organizations to make their websites accessible online.</p>
    <b>Web Deployment</b>
    <p>Web deployment refers to the process of making a web application or website accessible to users over the
      internet or an intranet. It involves setting up the necessary infrastructure, configuring servers, deploying
      application code, and ensuring the availability and reliability of the web application for end users. </p>

  <!-- Authentication CONTENT START --------------------------------------->
  <div class="content p-5" id="auth">
    <span id="cross" onclick="undo('auth')">╳</span>
    <h4 class="p-3 text-center">Authentication</h4>
    <p>Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of an individual, system, or entity attempting to
      access a particular resource or service. It ensures that the user or system is who or what they claim to be
      before granting access. Authentication is crucial for maintaining security and controlling access to sensitive
      information or systems.</p>
    <b>Username and Password </b>
    <p><b>Username :</b> A username is a unique identifier chosen by the user during the registration process. It's
      typically
      a string of characters that helps distinguish one user from another. Usernames are often displayed publicly
      within a system, such as on a profile page or when interacting with other users.</p>
    <p><b>Password :</b>A password is a confidential string of characters chosen by the user to prove their identity.
      It acts as a secret key that only the user should know. Passwords are kept private and should not be shared with
      others. They are used to authenticate the user's identity during login attempts.</p>
    <b>OAuth :</b>
    <p>OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for access delegation commonly used as a means for websites or
      applications to grant third-party access to resources without sharing passwords. It enables users to grant
      access to their resources stored on one site to another site, without sharing their credentials (such as
      username and password). OAuth is widely used by major companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others to
      allow users to grant third-party access to their information.</p>
    <b>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) :</b>
    <p>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is an authentication method that requires users to provide two or more
      different factors to verify their identity before granting access to a system, application, or service. MFA adds
      an extra layer of security beyond just a username and password combination, making it more difficult for
      unauthorized users to gain access.</p>
    <b>JSON Web Tokens (JWT) :</b>
    <p>JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two
      parties. They are designed to be easy to use for both clients and servers, and they allow information to be
      verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm)
      or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.</p>
    <b>Session-based Authentication :</b>
    <p>Session-based authentication is a method used by web applications to manage user authentication and
      authorization. It relies on the concept of sessions, which are temporary storage areas created on the server to
      store user-specific information during a user's interaction with the application.</p>
    <b>Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) :</b>
    <p>Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) are a type of two-factor authentication (2FA) method commonly used to
      enhance the security of online accounts and systems. TOTP relies on the generation of unique, time-based codes
      that are valid for only a short period of time and require the use of a shared secret between the user and the
      service provider.</p>
    <b>Passwordless Authentication :</b>
    <p>Passwordless authentication is a method of verifying a user's identity without requiring them to enter a
      traditional password. Instead of relying solely on something the user knows (i.e., a password), passwordless
      authentication methods typically use something the user has (e.g., a mobile device, email address) or something
      the user is (e.g., biometric data) to authenticate.</p>
    <b>Brute Force Protection :</b>
    <p>Brute force protection is a set of security measures implemented to prevent or mitigate brute force attacks. In
      a brute force attack, an attacker systematically tries all possible combinations of usernames, passwords, or
      encryption keys until the correct one is found. Brute force attacks are typically automated and can be used to
      gain unauthorized access to systems, applications, or accounts.</p>

    <h4 class="p-3 text-center">Web Security</h4>
    <p>Web security refers to the protection of websites, web applications, and web services from various online
      threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks. Ensuring web security is essential for safeguarding sensitive data,
      maintaining user trust, and preventing unauthorized access or malicious activities. Here are some key aspects of
      web security:</p>
    <b> Content Security Policy(CSP) :</b>
    <p>Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security standard implemented by web browsers to mitigate the risk of
      cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and other types of code injection attacks. CSP allows web developers to
      control and specify the trusted sources of content that can be executed or loaded by a web page, such as
      scripts, stylesheets, images, fonts, and multimedia resources.</p>
    <b> Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) :</b>
    <p>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control how web pages
      hosted on one domain can access resources (such as API endpoints) hosted on another domain. CORS is enforced by
      the browser to prevent potential security risks associated with cross-origin requests, such as cross-site
      request forgery (CSRF) and unauthorized data access.</p>
    <b>HTTPS :</b>
    <p>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension of HTTP that provides secure communication over the
      internet by encrypting data exchanged between a web browser and a web server. HTTPS uses SSL/TLS protocols to
      establish a secure connection and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of transmitted data.
    </p>
    <b>OWASP Security Risk :</b>
    <p>The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit organization dedicated to improving the
      security of software. OWASP provides resources, tools, and guidance to help organizations develop, deploy, and
      maintain secure web applications. One of the key contributions of OWASP is the OWASP Top 10, which is a
      regularly updated list of the most critical security risks facing web applications. The OWASP Top 10 serves as a
      guide for developers, security professionals, and organizations to prioritize their efforts in addressing common
      security vulnerabilities.</p>
