        <h4 class="p-3 text-center">Java</h4>
        <p>Java is a widely used, high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems
            (now owned by Oracle Corporation). It was first released in 1995 and has since become one of the most
            popular programming languages in the world.</p>
        <p>Java is known for its platform independence, meaning that Java programs can run on any device or
            operating system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, without needing to be recompiled. This
            is achieved through the principle of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA).</p>
        <b>Programming Concepts : </b>
        <p>Familiarize yourself with fundamental programming concepts such as <b>variables, data types, control
                structures (if statements, loops), functions/methods, and basic algorithms.</b> Even if you're new
            to
            programming, resources like online tutorials, books, and introductory courses can help you grasp these
            concepts.
        </p>
        <b>Java Development Environment Setup :</b>
        <p>Install a Java Development Kit (JDK) on your computer. The JDK includes
            the Java compiler (javac), runtime environment (JRE), and other development tools necessary for writing
            and
            running Java programs. Popular choices for IDEs include IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and NetBeans.</p>

    <!-- Authentication CONTENT START --------------------------------------->
    <div class="content p-5" id="auth">
        <span id="cross" onclick="undo('auth')">╳</span>
        <h4 class="p-3 text-center">Authentication</h4>
        <p>Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of an individual, system, or entity attempting to
            access a particular resource or service. It ensures that the user or system is who or what they claim to be
            before granting access. Authentication is crucial for maintaining security and controlling access to
            sensitive
            information or systems.</p>
        <b>Username and Password </b>
        <p><b>Username :</b> A username is a unique identifier chosen by the user during the registration process. It's
            typically
            a string of characters that helps distinguish one user from another. Usernames are often displayed publicly
            within a system, such as on a profile page or when interacting with other users.</p>
        <p><b>Password :</b>A password is a confidential string of characters chosen by the user to prove their
            identity.
            It acts as a secret key that only the user should know. Passwords are kept private and should not be shared
            with
            others. They are used to authenticate the user's identity during login attempts.</p>
        <b>OAuth :</b>
        <p>OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open standard for access delegation commonly used as a means for websites or
            applications to grant third-party access to resources without sharing passwords. It enables users to grant
            access to their resources stored on one site to another site, without sharing their credentials (such as
            username and password). OAuth is widely used by major companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and others
            to
            allow users to grant third-party access to their information.</p>
        <b>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) :</b>
        <p>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is an authentication method that requires users to provide two or more
            different factors to verify their identity before granting access to a system, application, or service. MFA
            adds
            an extra layer of security beyond just a username and password combination, making it more difficult for
            unauthorized users to gain access.</p>
        <b>JSON Web Tokens (JWT) :</b>
        <p>JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two
            parties. They are designed to be easy to use for both clients and servers, and they allow information to be
            verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC
            algorithm)
            or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.</p>
        <b>Session-based Authentication :</b>
        <p>Session-based authentication is a method used by web applications to manage user authentication and
            authorization. It relies on the concept of sessions, which are temporary storage areas created on the server
            to
            store user-specific information during a user's interaction with the application.</p>
        <b>Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) :</b>
        <p>Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) are a type of two-factor authentication (2FA) method commonly used to
            enhance the security of online accounts and systems. TOTP relies on the generation of unique, time-based
            codes
            that are valid for only a short period of time and require the use of a shared secret between the user and
            the
            service provider.</p>
        <b>Passwordless Authentication :</b>
        <p>Passwordless authentication is a method of verifying a user's identity without requiring them to enter a
            traditional password. Instead of relying solely on something the user knows (i.e., a password), passwordless
            authentication methods typically use something the user has (e.g., a mobile device, email address) or
            something
            the user is (e.g., biometric data) to authenticate.</p>
        <b>Brute Force Protection :</b>
        <p>Brute force protection is a set of security measures implemented to prevent or mitigate brute force attacks.
            In
            a brute force attack, an attacker systematically tries all possible combinations of usernames, passwords, or
            encryption keys until the correct one is found. Brute force attacks are typically automated and can be used
            to
            gain unauthorized access to systems, applications, or accounts.</p>

        <h4 class="p-3 text-center">RUBY</h4>
        <p>Ruby is an open-source, object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and productivity. It
            was designed and developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto ("Matz") in the mid-1990s with an emphasis on
            human-readable syntax and programmer happiness. Ruby is often used for web development, scripting,
            automation, and prototyping.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Simple and Elegant Syntax:</b> Ruby features a clean and intuitive syntax that emphasizes readability
                and expressiveness. It uses natural language constructs and follows the principle of least surprise,
                making it easy for developers to write and understand code.</li>
            <li><b>Object-Oriented:</b> Ruby is a pure object-oriented programming language, where everything is an
                object. It supports features like classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, allowing
                developers to build modular and reusable code.</li>
            <li><b>Dynamically Typed:</b> Ruby is dynamically typed, meaning variable types are determined at runtime
                rather than compile-time. This flexibility allows for rapid development and iteration but may require
                additional testing to catch type-related errors.</li>
            <li><b>Meta-Programming:</b> Ruby has powerful meta-programming capabilities that allow developers to modify
                and extend the language itself. This enables advanced features like method_missing, class_eval, and
                define_method, enabling developers to write concise and expressive code.</li>
            <li><b>Rich Standard Library:</b> Ruby comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides a wide
                range of built-in classes and modules for common tasks such as file I/O, string manipulation,
                networking, and more. This reduces the need for external dependencies and simplifies development.</li>
            <li><b>Community and Ecosystem:</b> Ruby has a vibrant and supportive community of developers who contribute

        <h4 class="p-3 text-center">C#</h4>
        <p>C# (pronounced "C sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft as part of
            its .NET framework. It was designed to be simple, type-safe, and versatile, with features that support a
            wide range of application development scenarios, including desktop, web, mobile, and cloud-based
            applications.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Object-Oriented:</b> C# is a powerful object-oriented programming language, providing support for
                features like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. It allows developers
                to model real-world entities and build modular, reusable code.</li>
            <li><b>Type-Safe:</b> C# is a statically typed language, which means variable types are determined at
                compile-time. This helps catch errors early in the development process and promotes code reliability and
                robustness.</li>
            <li><b>Managed Memory:</b> C# runs on the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which provides automatic memory

        <h4 class="p-3 text-center">Ruby on Rails</h4>
        <p>
            Ruby on Rails, commonly referred to as Rails, is a popular open-source web application framework written in
            the Ruby programming language. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and aims to
            simplify the development of web applications by providing conventions for common tasks.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Convention over Configuration:</b> Ruby on Rails promotes the principle of "convention over
                configuration," which means that developers only need to specify unconventional aspects of their
                application. Rails uses sensible defaults and conventions to reduce the amount of boilerplate code and
                configuration required.</li>
            <li><b>Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture:</b> Rails organizes applications based on the MVC
                architectural pattern, separating the application's data (model), user interface (view), and business
                logic (controller) into distinct components. This separation of concerns improves code organization,
                maintainability, and testability.</li>
            <li><b>Active Record ORM:</b> Rails includes Active Record, an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework
                that simplifies database interactions by mapping database tables to Ruby objects. Active Record provides
                convenient methods for querying, creating, updating, and deleting records, abstracting away the
                complexities of SQL.</li>
            <li><b>RESTful Routing:</b> Rails encourages the use of RESTful routing for defining application routes,
                following REST (Representational State Transfer) principles. Routes are defined using resourceful
                routing conventions, making it easy to create CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for
                resources.</li>
            <li><b>Automatic Code Generation:</b> Rails provides a set of command-line tools, known as generators, for
                automating repetitive tasks like creating models, controllers, views, migrations, and more. Generators
                scaffold the initial code structure based on predefined templates, allowing developers to quickly
                bootstrap new features.</li>
            <li><b>Convention-based Testing:</b> Rails includes built-in support for testing, with a focus on
                behavior-driven development (BDD) and test-driven development (TDD) practices. It includes testing
                frameworks like RSpec and MiniTest, along with tools for writing unit tests, integration tests, and
                system tests.</li>
            <li><b>Active Support Library:</b> Rails comes with the Active Support library, which provides a collection
                of utility classes, methods, and extensions to enhance Ruby's core functionality. Active Support
                includes features like date and time manipulation, internationalization, caching, and more.</li>
            <li><b>Security Features:</b> Rails includes built-in security features to protect against common web
                application vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), SQL
                injection, and session management issues. It provides mechanisms for parameter sanitization, CSRF
                protection, secure session storage, and more.</li>
            <li><b>Scalability and Performance:</b> Rails is designed to scale with the needs of growing applications,
                with features like database connection pooling, caching, background job processing, and load balancing.
                It provides tools and best practices for optimizing application performance and handling high traffic
                volumes.</li>
            <li><b>Community and Ecosystem:</b> Ruby on Rails has a vibrant community of developers who contribute to
                its development, share knowledge, and provide support. The Rails ecosystem includes a rich collection of
                gems (Ruby libraries), plugins, tutorials, and resources to help developers build and maintain Rails
                applications efficiently.</li>
